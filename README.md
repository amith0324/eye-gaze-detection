# Eye Gaze Detection for Home Automation

## Description
This project is an academic prototype that demonstrates eye-blink
detection using computer vision techniques. A webcam is used to
capture real-time video, and eye blinks are detected using OpenCV.
The detected blink can be used as a control signal for home
automation systems.

## How It Works
1. Webcam captures live video
2. Face and eye regions are detected using OpenCV
3. Eye blink is detected when eyes close briefly
4. Blink can be mapped to control appliances

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- Computer Vision
